- Vector: 4 numbers representing an X, Y, and Z position in 3D space, along with a 4th component:
(1 for positions, 0 for directions)

1 to the "right", 4 "up" and 5 "forward"
[2,4,5,1]

- Matrix: 4x4 set of numbers (in graphics programming) that represents some mutation (transformation) to perform on a vector.

Identity matrix (no operation):
[1,0,0,0]
[0,1,0,0]
[0,0,1,0]
[0,0,0,1]

Matrix * Matrix = Matrix
Matrix * Vector = Vector

Translation Matrix (Move in Space)
Rotation Matrix (Spins one around)
Scale Matrix

View Transform (Adjust virtual camera)
Projection Transform (Map 3D virtual space to 2D screen space)
